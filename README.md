# Smart-Fruit-Distribution-System
This project uses deep learning (ResNet-50) to predict the remaining shelf life of bananas based on their images, supporting sustainability-focused decisions.

ðŸ“Œ Problem -
Food waste is a major global challenge. This model helps in classifying bananas by estimated shelf life so they can be directed to:
- Warehouses for export
- Nearby vendors for quick sale
- Processing units (juice, pulp) if nearing spoilage

ðŸš€ Features -
- ResNet-50 pretrained backbone
- Balanced dataset using augmentation
- Regression model outputting shelf life in days
- Sustainability-based recommendations

ðŸ›  Tech Stack - 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
